# StackFit (Project: CalCalCal)
StackFit is a cross-platform mobile fitness app built with .NET MAUI. Workouts are organized as visual “Session Cards” (stacked like training sheets) and the app estimates workout duration and calories based on your profile and exercise configuration.

## Docs
- `APP_PLAN_STACKFIT.md` — central product + UX + architecture plan

- `DATENMODELL.md` — entities and storage model
- `KALORIEN-BERECHNUNG.md` — calculation logic and formulas
